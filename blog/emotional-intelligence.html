          </h3>
          <p>They are two different ways of being smart. IQ is "book smart", measuring cognitive abilities 
            and logical reasoning, while EQ is "people smart" measuring ability to handle social 
            complexities, motivate and connect with people.

          <p>High EQ is important in almost every area of life:

          
            <br />
            <br />
            In workplace, people with high EQ can handle stress better, communicate more effectively,
             and resolve confict more smoothly. 
            <br />
