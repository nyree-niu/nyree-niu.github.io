          <h3>1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to
             the Human Skills learning?</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <p>

                    I realized that I haven't learned new knowledge systematically for a long time, and at first, 
                    I struggled to find an efficient way to absorb new information with limited time. 
                    I started with pen/paper note-taking but switched to OneNote about four weeks ago, 
                    which has been very helpful. I also found it difficult to build a consistent daily study routine, 
                    but printing out codes and notes to review has helped reinforce my memory. 
                    I've been trying to write down coding logic in as much detail as possible to strengthen my understanding.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What worries me most is that I usually don't express my feelings to others, and I've never considered myself 
                    a “people person”. At work, I tend to quietly focus on getting my tasks done and often avoid bringing up 
                    problems to others. I see myself as more technical, and I feel comfortable in that "solo" role. 
                    I need to change the mindset. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    From the previous listening and looping practice, I noticed that I have difficulty concentrating — my mind tends 
                    to drift away after a few minutes. I tried applying the same method at work, but in the workplace, 
                    there are not always opportunities to loop back and get feedback from others, unless you asked for it.
                    I hope in bootcamp I can practice this listening and looping skill and improve my ability to stay focused.
                    <br />
                    <br />
            
            </p>
           </ul>
            

          
            
          
          <h3>
            2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
          </h3>
            <ul><p>
            Values:  how to face challenges, collaborate with others, and stay motivated when things get difficult. 
      
            </p>
            <p>
            Empathy: understanding different perspectives, communicating effectively, and being patient with others' learning processes. 
            </p>

          
            <p>Self-awareness: recognise my strengths and weaknesses, manage frustration, and identify areas where need to grow.
            </p>
                     <br />
                    <br />
            </ul>
           
            
            
          

          <h3>3. What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
          <ul><p>
           It feels like a group healing or psychology session for me. However, I didn't realize that I needed it before.
           What I've taken from it are: 
           
                  <li>Growth mindset, dont look down yourself. </li>
                  <li>Meditation is not a waste of time, but helping ease stress and focusing on the present, in turn creating a positive mindset.</li>
                  <li>Repeat and persistence can change the brain and help store new knowledge more effectively. </li>
          <br />
                    <br />
                </p>
           
          </ul>


           <h3>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning??</h3>
            <ul>
              <p>For me is to complete reflections, I don't do proper writing very often in real life.
               Meditation for five minutes daily is also a challenge. 
               Shall we have a meditation session I actualy don't know how exactly I shall do. 
              
               <br />
                    <br />
            </p>
             
            </ul>



           <h3>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending 
            so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course??</h3>
          <ul><p>
         It helps us become more prepared to secure a job and develop a healthier, more positiv
         e mindset when facing challenges. Learning these skills benefits us not only professionally but also in our personal lives in the long run.
<br /><br />
                    </p></ul>


<h3>6. Does the time you spent studying Human 
  Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
   time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
         <ul><p>
         No, it is not a waste of time. If the study focuses only on coding and ignores the emotional aspects, 
         perhaps 50% of students might give up after the foundation stage. 
         
         Developing self-awareness and reflecting on 
         experiences can help us stay motivated and better handle challenges. 
     
         I also believe that having solid coding skills is essential, as they form the foundation for professional growth 
         and future success.

        </ul>
