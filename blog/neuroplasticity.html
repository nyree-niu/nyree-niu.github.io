          <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>  
          <h3>1. Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
          
          <p>Understanding neuroplasticity benefits people by showing them that their brains can be reshaped through consistent practice and challenges. 
          It provides a scientific foundation for building the mindset that skills can be developed through focus, regular practice, and resilience.</p>
        
            
            <br />
          <h3>2.Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
           
          <p><strong>Practice makes perfect and permanent: </strong>This applies to all types of learning.
            With limited study time, it’s important to focus on quality and consistency in every study session.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Concentration: </strong> Stay focused on what I’m doing by putting my phone away and studying in a quiet, distraction-free environment.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Review: </strong> Regularly revisit what I’ve learned to strengthen memory and understanding.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Note-taking and reflection:</strong>
            Actively taking notes and reflecting on what I've learned can strengthen neural pathways in the brain. 
            By organizing information, making connections, and revisiting ideas, these practices reinforce memory, 
            deepen understanding, and enhance reshaping of brain.
            </p>
           
            <br />
            <h3>3. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
           <p>In addition to consistent practices engaged in learning a new skill, supporting brain with proper nutrition, 
            quality sleep, and a healthy mind is essential for enhancing 
           focus, improving the quality of learning, and increase neuroplasticity. </p>
           <ul>
              <li>Move more, think better</li>
              <li>Fuel your brain with the right foods</li> 
              <li>Keep brain active through lifelong learning</li> 
              <li>Prioritize quality sleep</li> 
              <li>Stress less for a healthier brain</li> 
              <li>Stay socially engaged</li> 
            </ul>

          <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>  
          <h3>1.Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
          <p>A growth mindset is the belief that talents and abilities can be developed through effort, effective learning strategies, and persistence. People with a growth mindset understand that progress may come at different speeds, but they trust that they can improve and get smarter through consistent hard work.</p>
          <h3>2. In this exploration, did anything surprise you or change for you</h3>  
          <p> I shared Carol Dweck’s TED Talk with my husband, and it was both surprising and motivating for me. I realized that these concepts are not only helpful for my own growth but also valuable for raising and educating our children, e.g. "praise the process". I’ve also learned that confidence builds when I can prove to myself that I’m capable. While I may feel anxious and struggle before reaching my goals, each success reinforces a positive belief that I can achieve more in the future.</p>
          <h3>3. How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>View each chanllenge a chance of grow;</li>
            <li>View each mistake as a learning opportunity.</li>
           </ul>
