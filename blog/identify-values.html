          <h2>
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

            My son plays in a Grade 9 soccer team. He works very hard, training twice a week and putting in a lot of effort to improve his skills. At this stage, the matches are no longer just internal club games — the competition is tougher because we play against teams from other clubs. Winning has become harder, and the pressure is higher.Two players on the team, while talented, have been less committed in training. They often skip practices and don’t seem to put in the same effort as others. Yet, they are often given priority positions during games because of their natural skill.
