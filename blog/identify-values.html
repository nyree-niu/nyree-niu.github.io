            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the

          <ul><p>My son plays in a Grade 9 soccer team. He works very hard, 
            training twice a week and putting in a lot of effort to improve his skills. 
            At this stage, the matches are no longer just internal club games â€” 
            the competition is tougher because we play against teams from other clubs. 
            Winning has become harder, and the pressure is higher. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Two players on the team, 
            while talented, have been less committed in training. Often in matches, 
            they are not actively involved by running around or trying to score,
            which is frustrating for the rest of the team.
            This has led to a situation where the team is not performing well.
            Those boys are all friends, from the same school, they grew up togather, 
            it is a hard dicision to drop them off the team. 
             <br />
             <br />
           
            We decided to have a private conversation 
            with coach about how equal commitment and effort should be encouraged and valued. 
            An election process may should be introduced when they start Grade 10 soccer next winter.

            I grew up in China, where the culture is very different from New Zealand. 
            In China, the culture is more collectivist, where group harmony, family reputation, 
            and community interests often come before individual desires.
            In New Zealand, the culture is more individualistic, where personal freedom, independence, 
            and self-expression are strongly valued.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have been influenced by both cultures. 
            I value family and community, but I also value personal freedom and independence. 
            I respect personal choices on what they believe and what they do.

            3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Firstly, I have a strong motivation to learn coding. There have been news recently about 
            outsourcing basic accounting jobs to AI, even though it will take time to expand
            to different industries but I do need to be prepared for the future.
            I know that AI can do many things, including writing code, building websites. 
            But to truly take advantage of the knowledge and solutions AI provides, I still need 
            to learn and understand code myself. 
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, I consider myself a problem solver in my professional life. 
            I enjoy investigating variances, identifying patterns, 
            and finding practical solutions that improve processes. 
            Learning to code will strengthen this ability, allowing me to 
            approach problems more efficiently and creatively.
 
            <br />

          <h3>
            4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development. How might these affect your learning journey?
          </h3>
          <p>One limitation I face in my learning and career development is time management. 
            Balancing work responsibilities, personal commitments, and learning new skills 
            like coding can sometimes be challenging. Without careful planning, 
            I risk not dedicating enough time to fully absorb new concepts.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another limitation is my current level of technical knowledge.
            While I am motivated to learn coding and problem-solving, 
            my current experience with programming is limited. 
            This means I need extra time to understand complex concepts, 
            debug code, or apply theoretical knowledge to practical projects.

            <br />
            <br />

            5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
            others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
            tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
            what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Well, working in a finance team may somewhat different 
            from wroking directly on client project.
            We usually focus on our own tasks which are seperated from others but could 
            potentially have an impact on tasks handled by others. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Communication is the key. Effective communication is essential. 
            Informing colleagues in advance about potential issues and 
            keeping them updated throughout the process can prevent 
            misunderstandings and reduce tension significantly. 
           <br />
            <br />
            In addition, setting up mutual goals and timelines together helps 
            ensure everyone is aligned. It also makes sure that each 
            team member clearly understands their role and responsibilities, 
            which further reduces confusion and tension.
