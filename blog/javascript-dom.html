          <h2>24-08-2025</h2>
          <p>Building a website requires three core languages: <strong> HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>. <br /> <br />
            HTML determine the content and structure, CSS controls the style and appearance, and JavaScript makes the website 
            fun and interesting, by adding interactivity and dynamic behaviors.  
            <br /> <br />     
              Liking creating a cartoon character, HTML determines blueprint such as how big the eyes are and where they are placed, CSS determines the color and shape of eyes, and JavaScript make the cartoon character interact with audience:  if you blink, the cartoon blinks backs.
              <br /> <br />
              In addition to the three core languages, there is another tool which is essential for website developers.
              The <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> is a programming interface that web browsers create from HTML. 
              It represents a webpage as a tree of objects. Each part of the page—like headings, paragraphs, buttons, or images—becomes a node in this tree.
              Web developers use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM—they can add, remove, or change elements on a webpage dynamically without reloading the page.
              <br /> <br />In other words, DOM is a live model of your webpage that JavaScript can talk to and change in real time.


              Google Chrome is one of the most popular browsers that lets you inspect and manipulate the DOM. User can access to it by opening any website of interest, and use short cut Command + Option + J (Mac).
              <br /> <br />
            
            
            Control flow is the order in which steps in a program are executed. Just like in real life, you often follow a sequence of steps to complete a task. For example, I want to make an espresso to start my day:
<br /> <br />
<ol>
  <li>Turn on the coffee machine.</li>
<li>Measure coffee beans.</li>
<li>Pour beans into the grinder.</li>
<li>Attach the portafilter to the grinder.</li>
<li>Grind the beans.</li>
<li>Move the portafilter to the espresso machine.</li>
<li>Place an empty cup under the portafilter.</li>
<li>Start brewing.</li>
<li><strong>If water is low, refill and restart brewing.</strong></li>
<li>Pour milk into a steaming cup.</li>
<li>Steam the milk to the desired temperature.</li>
<li>Stop steaming.</li>
<li>Pour milk into the brewed espresso.</li>
</ol>

At step 9, there’s a small loop: if the machine needs more water, refill it and loop back to step 8 to restart brewing. Once brewing begins, the process continues normally. The loop stops when the conditions meet (water refilled), and the loop won't start if there are enough water (refill not need).
<br /> <br /><br /> <br />
Array is an ordered list of items. Each item in the array has its position, and the position starts from 0 not 1. We use square brackets to represent array. In below example. Fruit [0] returns "apple".
<br /> <br />
For example:
<code><strong>Let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</strong></code>
<br /> <br />

<br /> <br />

Object is a collection of key and value pairs. We use curve bracket to represent object. In object "person", 
name and age are keys, and "alice" and 25 are key's values. person.name will return "Alice". person.age will return 25.
<br /> <br />
For example:
<code><strong>Let person = {name: "Alice", age: 25}</strong></code>
<br /> <br />
<br /> <br />

A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task in JavaScript.
<ul>
<li>It can be write once and be used many times.</li>
<li>It can also take input (called parameters) and return output (results).</li>

</ul>

For example,
<code> <strong><br />
  Function greeting (name) { <br />
          Return " Hello " + name <br />
  } <br /></strong>
      </code>


If we let name = "World", the function will return Hello World.
If we let name = "Alice", the function will return Hello Alice.
