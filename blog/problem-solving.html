          <h2>07-09-2025</h2>
            
          <h3>1. Were blocked on a simple problem: </h3>
          <p><strong>What was the problem? </strong> I used console.log() for manual testing to check what result I got. However, 
            I was stuck on the Kata gradebook addScore challenge because the test kept failing.
          <br />
          <br />



          <strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use? </strong>I talked through the problem (rubber duck) and realized that I 
                  forgot to delete the console.log() statement at the end of my code. The manual testing (console.log) was already added the score to Susan[4] , 
              however, the auto-testing code added the score again to Susan[5], causing the test to fail.
            <br />
            <br />
          
            

          <strong>How did you feel throughout the process? </strong>I felt frustrated at first because everything in the code seemed to work, but I still could not pass the test.
              Even though the manual testing I added did not change the actual results, it was surprising to see how a small detail 
              like a console.log() statement could cause auto-testing failed.
              <br />
              <br />
            
          
          <strong>what did you learn? </strong> I learned that testing code can provide useful information about where an error is happening.
                 I also learned that leaving manual testing code in place can interfere with automated tests. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />


           </p>




           <h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
          <p><strong>What was the problem? </strong> When I was completing the Kata FlipFlop challenges, I realized I needed use conditional methods, such if(). However, I can't remember the specific codes. 
I also didn't know what divisiable code was, I only find out the hints were provided in handbook after I completed the challenge.
          <br />
          <br />



          <strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use? </strong>I first reviewed how to use an if() statement. Then, I used Google to learn how to write code that checks if a number, A, is divisible by another number, B, with no remainder.
The next step was to figure out the order of the if() conditions. I had to decide which conditions should be checked first, second, and so on, 
to make sure I covered all the different senarios.

            <br />
            <br />
          
            

          <strong>How did you feel throughout the process? </strong>Since I use conditional formulas daily at work, the logic of the challenge wasn't difficult for me. The biggest challenge was remembering the correct syntax for the operators like equal to, and, and or. I add comments above my coding so I can easier review them going forward. 
              <br />
              <br />
            
          
          <strong>what did you learn? </strong> It’s important to repeat practices to strengthen neural pathways and improve memory. I’m sure that if I stop using those syntax or conditions, I’ll have to go through the same problem-solving process all over again. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
           </p>





               <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
          <p><strong>Pseudocode: </strong> <em>7/10. </em> Writing out the logic in plain language before coding helps clarify the steps and makes coding easier. 
            However, I can write down steps if I do know about it. At this stage I am not good enough at writing codes that effectively implement the steps. 
            I should practice more to familier with coding instructions and what codes could represent the instructions.

          <br />
          <br />



          <strong>Trying something: </strong><em>7/10.</em> I tried coding but did not work due to limited coding knowledge. 
I think don’t wait for the perfect plan by spending huge amount of time on researching. I googled and asked ChatGPT, and learn from the ideas I got. 

            <br />
            <br />
          
            

          <strong>Rubber ducky: </strong><em>10/10. </em>By speak loud of my thought process, I can notice mistakes, gaps in logic, or maybe new solutions.
              <br />
              <br />
            
          
          <strong>Reading error messages: </strong><em>8/10.</em>I keep seeing “undefined,” but I still don’t know where the problem is.
              <br />
              <br />

          <strong>Console.logging and googling: </strong> <em>10/10. </em> I frequently used console logging to do unit testing. If the test result is not what I expected, I will google to find a solution.
              <br />
              <br />


          <strong>Asking your peers/coaches for help: </strong> <em>8/10. </em> I perfer to do research myself and find out answers first. It is great I got peers and coaches there to help when I really got stucked. When working as team toward a project, my reluctant-to-ask approach may not ideal as we will have deadline to meet.
              <br />
              <br />


          <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong> <em>8/10. </em>It is a brilliant habit to pause and reflect on what I've learned in the last session. I'll trying to make it a habit, currently I alway rush to complete the learning. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />


          <h3>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>
          It often depends on the situations, whether I am working independently or as part of a team, and whether I have an urgent deadline to meet. 
          I am usually reluctant to ask for help when I am working independently or I’m learning something new because I feel I need to fully understand 
          it on my own. 
          I worry that asking too early might make me seem unprepared.
<br />
<br />
However, I’ve realized that trying to solve everything by myself can slow down my progress and sometimes even create more confusion, 
espeically as a part of team and working toward a same goal. 
So I plan to ask help strategically by identifying exactly what I don’t understand and then ask.
