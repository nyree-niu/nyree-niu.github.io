            1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
          </h3>
          <p>My long term goal is to be able to create website for customers, maybe as a freelancer.
            
            <br />
            <br />

           2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
          </h3>
          <p>Strengths: <br />
            Strong motivation on learning codes <br />
            Proved problem solving skills at work <br />

            <br />
            Limitations: <br />
            Poor time management, have to balance learning with other life and work committments <br />
            Limited relative coding knowledge leads to extra effort on absorbing knowledge
            
          
            <br />

          <h3>
           3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h3>
          <p>I would like to develop stronger skills in understanding customer needs 
            and translating them into project requirements. I also want to improve 
            my ability to collaborate effectively with a team, learning how to 
            contribute while respecting different perspectives. Another area I 
            hope to grow in is identifying the role I should play within a project, 
            so I can work with clarity and confidence. Finally, I want to better 
            understand the boundaries of duties and responsibilities, so that I can 
            communicate clearly and support the team without creating confusion.
            
          </p>
          <h3>
           4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
           This should include:
          </h3>

          <h4>(1)An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively 
            and safely with other learners, 
            Facilitators and industry/community representatives </h4>

          <p>When working as part of a team, I understand that every contribution
             is important to the overall process. I will commit to following the 
             project timeline and make sure I provide regular updates on my 
             progress. If I encounter any roadblocks, I will communicate them in 
             a timely manner so the team can adjust and support each other as needed. 
             I will approach the work as if I were contributing to a real client project,
              which will help me stay accountable and professional.
              <br />
              <br />

              <h4>(2) What you will do when
             things are building up and starting to get to you?</h4>
              When I feel things are building up or becoming overwhelming, 
              I will take short breaks to reset and manage stress. 
              I will also be open about how I am feeling and ask for 
              support when necessary, rather than trying to handle everything alone. 
              This way, I can maintain both productivity and well-being while 
              working with learners, facilitators, and industry representatives.
            
          </p>
          <h3>
            4. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </h3>
          <p>
            I will use discord to seek help by posting message under thread #help-desk or #home-group. 
          </p>

          <h3>
            5. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
          </h3>

          <p>
            I would like to have some feedback from facilitators on the learning I've done so far. 
             
          </p>
          <h3>
            6. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed 
            to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments 
            like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          </h3>

          <p>I have two primary school age children to look after and a full time job, 
            so I usually study at night or on weekend. The busiest period at work had just past
          so I will try my best to keep up with learning schedule.</p>
